Issue:
When running tests or the /api/v1/send-otp endpoint, OpenTelemetry's BatchSpanProcessor with ConsoleSpanExporter tried to export spans after the test framework closed stdout, resulting in "ValueError: I/O operation on closed file" and 500 errors.

Fix:
Replaced BatchSpanProcessor with SimpleSpanProcessor in app/telemetry.py when TESTING is enabled. This exports spans synchronously, avoiding background flush after stdout is closed.

Other Modifications:
No changes needed for production configuration; OTLP exporter remains for non-testing environments.
